Contributing
============

We welcome contributions of all from everybody, and we will make an effort
to respond to any questions and requests. Code is not the only way to make
a contribution!

If you end up using our library in a project, give us a star on GitHub!

Code Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- With any piece of code, please adhere to PEP-8 standards.
- If you're fixing an issue with an existing piece of code, please make sure
all the tests pass, and there is no change in functionality.
- If you want to add a new feature, please open up an issue first.
- When adding a new feature, make sure you have relevant test coverage.
- Any changes to the public API should conform to the current standards,
be properly documented, typed, and be intuitive.

Documentation Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Make sure you follow the standards set by the rest of the repo.
- Be concise, but do not omit details. Verbose documentation is preferred to
incomplete documentation.
