# Mab2Rec: Multi-Armed Bandits Recommender 

Mab2Rec is a Python library for building bandit-based recommendation algorithms. It supports **context-free**, **parametric** and **non-parametric** **contextual** bandit models powered by [MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser) and fairness and recommenders evaluations powered by [Jurity](https://github.com/fidelity/jurity).
It supports [all bandit policies available in MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser#available-bandit-policies). The library is designed with rapid experimentation in mind, follows the [PEP-8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and is tested heavily.

Mab2Rec and several other open-source software it is built on is developed by the AI Center at Fidelity:

* [MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser) to create multi-armed bandit recommendation algorithms ([IJAIT'21](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218213021500214), [ICTAI'19](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8995418)).
* [TextWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/textwiser) to create item representations via text featurization ([AAAI'21](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17814)).
* [Selective](https://github.com/fidelity/selective) to create user representations via feature selection.
* [Seq2Pat](https://github.com/fidelity/seq2pat) to enhance users representations via sequential pattern mining ([AAAI'22](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/)).
* [Jurity](https://github.com/fidelity/jurity) to evaluate recommendations including fairness metrics ([ICMLA'21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680169)).
* [Spock](https://github.com/fidelity/spock) to define, manage, and use parameter configurations.

An introduction to **content- and context-aware** recommender systems and an overview of the building blocks of the library is [presented at All Things Open 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54d_YUalvOA). 

Documentation is available at [fidelity.github.io/mab2rec](https://fidelity.github.io/mab2rec).

## Usage Patterns

Mab2Rec supports prototyping of **individual** bandit algorithms and benchmarking of **multiple** bandit algorithms. 
The intended usage for a new user is to experiment with multiple bandits using the tutorial in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder.

## Quick Start

### Individual Recommender

```python
# Example of how to train an individual recommender to generate top-4 recommendations

# Import 
from mab2rec import BanditRecommender, LearningPolicy
from mab2rec.pipeline import train, score

# LinGreedy recommender to select top-4 items with 10% random exploration 
rec = BanditRecommender(LearningPolicy.LinGreedy(epsilon=0.1), top_k=4)

# Train on (user, item, response) interactions in train data using user features 
train(rec, data='data/data_train.csv', 
      user_features='data/features_user.csv')

# Score recommendations for users in test data. The output df holds 
# user_id, item_id, score columns for every test user for top-k items 
df = score(rec, data='data/data_test.csv', 
           user_features='data/features_user.csv')
```

### Multiple Recommenders

```python
# Example of how to benchmark multiple bandit algorithms to generate top-4 recommendations

from mab2rec import BanditRecommender, LearningPolicy
from mab2rec.pipeline import benchmark
from jurity.recommenders import BinaryRecoMetrics, RankingRecoMetrics

# Recommenders (many more available)
recommenders = {"Random": BanditRecommender(LearningPolicy.Random()),
                "Popularity": BanditRecommender(LearningPolicy.Popularity()),
                "LinGreedy": BanditRecommender(LearningPolicy.LinGreedy(epsilon=0.1))}

# Column names for the response, user, and item id columns
metric_params = {'click_column': 'score', 'user_id_column': 'user_id', 'item_id_column':'item_id'}

# Performance metrics for benchmarking (many more available)
metrics = []
for top_k in [3, 5, 10]:
    metrics.append(BinaryRecoMetrics.CTR(**metric_params, k=top_k))
    metrics.append(RankingRecoMetrics.NDCG(**metric_params, k=top_k))

# Benchmarking with a collection of recommenders and metrics 
# This returns two dictionaries; 
# reco_to_results: recommendations for each algorithm on cross-validation data
# reco_to_metrics: evaluation metrics for each algorithm
reco_to_results, reco_to_metrics = benchmark(recommenders,
                                             metrics=metrics,
                                             train_data="data/data_train.csv",
                                             cv=5,
                                             user_features="data/features_user.csv")
```
